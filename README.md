## Notes

### Backend

### Frontend

-   I decided to use Foundation as it was mentioned during the interview, and I've never used this framework before. Perfect time to try it out.

-   If I had more time I'd work more on a thematic presentaton for the page.

### (Possible) Bugs

-

### Other things

-   I don't know what `phpcs.xml.dist` is exactly for. I left it in the repo, the only changes I made is to add `node_modules` to list of excludes.

-   I decided not to include webpack and babel in this project as I know I'm not using a lot of JavaScript and don't want to spend the time messing with webpack configs.
